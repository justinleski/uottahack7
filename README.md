## Key Features and Functionality

### 1. Animal Spotting & Identification
- **Core Functionality:**
  - Users take pictures of animals they encounter and upload them to the app.
  - Integrated AI-based animal recognition software automatically identifies the species (e.g., "Black Bear," "Moose," "Snowy Owl").
- **Crowdsourced Verification:**
  - If the AI cannot confidently identify an animal, users or expert reviewers can verify and tag the sighting.

### 2. Geolocation Tracking
- **Purpose:**
  - Automatically captures GPS location from the photo’s metadata to map animal distribution, migration, and habitat usage.
- **Privacy Measures:**
  - Users can anonymize their data or opt out of location sharing for sensitive sightings (e.g., endangered species).

### 3. Gamification and Rewards
- **Rewards System:**
  - Earn points and "WildCoins" for validated sightings.
  - WildCoins can be redeemed for in-app perks (e.g., badges, profile customization) or donated to conservation efforts.
- **Leaderboards:**
  - Compete on leaderboards by region, sighting frequency, or unique species spotted.
  - Special challenges encourage seasonal engagement (e.g., "Spot the Snowy Owl this Winter").

### 4. Educational Features
- **Wildlife Encyclopedia:**
  - Detailed profiles for each species, including behavior, habitat, and conservation status.
- **Interactive Learning:**
  - Gamified quizzes and mini-games teach users about ecology and animal behavior.

### 5. Data Transparency and Open Access
- **For Researchers:**
  - Data (photos, timestamps, geolocations) is made available to conservationists, ecologists, and wildlife scientists.
- **For the Public:**
  - Wildlife heatmaps and trends foster awareness of local biodiversity.

### 6. Community Engagement
- **Story Sharing:**
  - Share stories or journal entries about sightings, complete with photos and personal observations.
- **User Groups:**
  - Collaborate with local wildlife groups or schools on challenges or campaigns.
